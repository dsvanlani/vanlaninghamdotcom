##Vanlaningham.com - Reviews

Hi Dad - here is some documentation on how to use your website to 
post your reviews.

###How To...

#### Upload a new review:
First make sure you're logged in, go to www.vanlaningham.com/admin
and use your credentials with username nvanlani.

Then go to www.vanlaningham.com/addReview/ and it will bring you 
to a form that will allow you to upload a new review.  Some notes
on the format here:
 * the *bookISBN* can be either the 13 or 10 digit version, this is mostly for a unique ID
 for the URL but I'd like to use it to incorporate API features
 in the future.
 * Try to keep the bookTitle field less than 55 characters. For example
 "The Chosen Primate: Human Nature and Cultural Diversity" is at the 
 very top end of what will work in the "book review cards" and
 not cause weird wrapping.  Consider omitting the colon for longer
 titles.
 * the thumbnail should be a jpg or png format, and doesn't
 need to be smaller "thumnail" resolution but it might help loading speed.
 * content, So as of now you can upload directly as a docx format
 but I still haven't gotten the conversion to be completely bug 
 free.
