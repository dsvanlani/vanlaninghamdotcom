I have probably read more science-fiction and fantasy than anything, but that is likely a function of it having been favored by my oldest brother, who dominated my reading lists, when I was young.  Arthur C. Clark, Isaac Asimov, J.R.R. Tolkien, Larry Niven were all heavy hitters in a much larger universe of speculative fiction from which I selected.  One of those authors, frequenting my reading was Roger Zelazny.  According to Wikipedia, he was born in 1937 and died in 1995.  He was also a native of Ohio, a state in which I have resided for nearly sixteen years.  I have read many of his novels, though not all.  Generally purchased as pulp paperbacks, the books would become dog-eared through each successive reading.  As an adult, I have sometimes returned, no longer seeing the story with a male protagonist satisfying because a fantastic hero kicked the asses of his detractors, instead the books have become treatises of philosophy embedded within a fun tale.  <em>Lord of Light</em> by Roger Zelazny is just such a book.</p><p>I have often felt that there was an entire world of knowledge everybody had but me.  Like I was on the outside, sealed away from a private party, commonly known about but no one would admit was happening.  A friend of mine once shared a poem, in high-school which captures the idea.</p><p><em>Oh little boy, with your nose pressed against the glass</em></p><p><em>We have no jelly donuts</em></p><p><em>For you today</em></p><p>So, as part of my efforts to redress this permanent sense of disenfranchisement from the soiree  of common knowledge, I read a book called <em>How to Read Literature Like a Professor</em> by Thomas C. Foster.  The names of some of the chapters of the book are as follows: <em>Every Trip is a Quest (Except When It’s Not); When in Doubt, It’s from Shakespeare…; Or the Bible; If She Comes Up, It’s Baptism; </em>or<em> It’s Never Just Heart Disease</em>.  It is with that background and a superficial exposure to Kant and Plato that I came to believe that authors must pick the elements of their stories from a list of ingredients, like an episode of <em>Iron Chef</em>.  Thus, the high-school English student’s skepticism described below by Professor Foster is addressed not by every single arch-type within the story being purposefully selected by the author, but rather because the teller-of-the-tale has a finite number of Lego blocks from which to choose to build her or his work.</p><p>“<em>A moment occurs in this exchange between professor and student when each of us adopts a look.  My look says, ‘What you don’t get it?’  Theirs says, ‘We don’t get it.  And we think you’re making it up.</em>’” (Foster, p xiii)</p><p>All of the types of human experiences are still a finite list of ingredients to use in the constructing of story.  Even if it were possible to include items in the recipe never before seen by mankind, the reader would not be able to relate to those new additional items because their ability to experience the narrative is limited to the ingredients they know.</p><p>So, when I return to one of the fun reads of my youth, I find them stuffed with allusions and content that I did not appreciate during earlier times.   At 54, I have had many more experiences and therefore can be moved by gradations of gray and nuances that had previously slipped by, unnoticed.  The rereading feels like a first-time reading, but the distracting effort of decoding an author’s style, vocabulary and narrative structure is not the obstacle it once was, allowing me to enjoyably focus on what is now a multi-layered tale.  The science-fiction or fantasy novel is both familiar and brand new.  The original story is still swash-buckling but the new reading is also imaginatively expansive and sometimes enlightening.</p><p>One of the conclusions I had reached about speculative fiction, that I did not think about as an adolescent was that an author could use the setting of the story, like a laboratory.  She or he may intentionally isolate and test for what is persistently human by changing the environment and writing characters with those attributes that would match our expectations as if the story took place in a familiar location.  The environment has changed but the humans still show the behaviors, speech and predilections that are characteristic of the members of our species, allowing us to see attributes of humanity that might have been hidden in the mosaic of our pedestrian existence.  A fun example of this phenomenon is seen in the graphic-novel and movie of the title <em>The Watchmen</em>.  In its most stripped down interpretation, the author asks the reader the question, “What would the world be like if there really were the superheroes of the comics, from our childhood?”  <em>The Watchmen</em> is a dystopian superhero story, exploring human psychology in a hyper-real, even gritty universe.  What are the mental and emotional idiosyncrasies of the protagonists causing them to wear colorful Spandex outfits and serve as violent vigilantes?  How would society develop differently, if during the Cold War and later such heroes were part of life’s experiences and their exploits reported on the nightly news?  </p><p>Returning to some of the Zelazny books that I have read many times, often decades earlier, I find them fast, painless and fun.  They have volumes more to say to me than I heard or understood, when I was younger.  <em>Lord of Light</em> is maybe my favorite novel, ever.</p><p>It is about a human colony on an earth-like planet, the humans having commandeered a world that already had life, including intelligent life.  The colonists violently conquer the planet and its inhabitants in response to their own need to survive.  Earth had previously been destroyed, though the book does not tell us how.  The technology developed to survive the inter-stellar voyage (as well as conquer the natives of the new world) and the physical characteristics of the indigenous aliens display a compatibility with Hindu mythology.   “’<em>It was their world first,’ said Sam [hero of the book].  ‘We took it away from them.  Why shouldn’t they be everything we hate them for being?  To them, we are the demons?’” (Zelazny, p157)  </em>Both the colonists and the planetary natives show great control over matter, energy, life and appearances.  </p><p>Those humans descended from the original colonists are excluded from this artificial Hindu pantheon and display social development and behaviors consistent with Mr. Zelazny’s pessimistic view of humanity and religion.  The excluded human progeny are ignorant that technology and science are the source of the powers of the original colonists and in fact consider them Gods.  The plot of the novel is driven forward by one of the original conquerors, Sam acting on his belief in an obligation to share the benefits of technology with the descendants of the colonists.  Such sharing would end the hegemony of science and exploitation of the masses.  “<em>I felt that we of the crew should be assisting them, granting them the benefits of the technology we had preserved, rather than building ourselves an impregnable paradise and treating the world as a combination game preserve and whorehouse.</em>” (Zelazny, p63). The idea that technology was identical to how humans in history described miracles reminds of me a famous quote from Arthur C. Clark, “<em>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic</em>.” (Clark)  I do not have the original source, which is from <em>Profiles of the Future: An Enquiry into the Limits of the Possible</em>.</p><p>The first recapitulation of philosophy I wish to discuss is a place where the protagonist is playing the role of a charlatan Buddha.  He is asked by his conspirators to provide a sermon to distract the audience while the rebels attempt to cover their profane acts against their former colleagues, the Gods.  The congregation has seen the cohort’s treason against the false Gods and so represent a risk to the rebel’s endeavors.</p><p>“’Sam sat with his eyes closed for several minutes, then said softly:</p><p>I have many names, and none of them matter.’ He opened his eyes slightly then, but he did not move his head.  He looked upon nothing in particular.</p><p>‘Names are not important, ‘ he said.  ‘To speak is to name names, but to speak is not important.  A thing happens once that has never happened before.  Seeing it, a man looks upon reality.  He cannot tell others what he has seen.  Others wish to know, however, so they question him saying, What is it like, this thing you have seen?’  So he tries to tell them.  Perhaps he has seen the very first fire in the world.  He tells them, ‘It is red, like a poppy, but through it dance other colors.  It has no form, like water, flowing everywhere.  It is warm like the sun of summer, only warmer.  It exists for a time upon a piece of wood, and then the wood is gone as though it were eaten, leaving behind that which is black and can be sifted like sand.  When the wood is gone, it too is gone.’  Therefore, the hearers must think reality is like a poppy, like water, like the sun, like that which eats and excretes.  They think it is like to anything that they are told it is like by the man who has known it. But they have not looked upon fire.  They cannot really know it.  They can only know of it.  But fire comes again into the world, many times. More men look upon fire.  After a time, fire is as common as grass and clouds and the air they breathe.  They see that while it is like a poppy, it is not a poppy, while it is like water, it is not water, while it is like the sun, it is not the sun and while it is like that which eats and passes wastes, it is not that which eats and passes wastes, but something different from each of these apart or all of these together.  So they look upon this new thing and the make a new word to call it.  They call it “fire.”</p><p>If they come upon one who still has not seen it and they speak to him of fire, he does not know what they mean.  So they, in turn, fall back upon telling him what fire is like.  As they do so, they know from their own experience that what they are telling him is not the truth, but only a part of it.  They know that this man will never know reality from their words, though all the words in the world are theirs to use.  He must look upon the fire, smell of it, warm his hands by it, stare into its heart or remain forever ignorant.  Therefore, “fire” does not matter, “earth” and “air” and “water” do not matter.  “I” do not matter.  No word matters.  But man forgets reality and remembers words.  The more words he remembers, the cleverer do his fellows esteem him.  He looks upon the great transformations of the world but he does not see them as they were seen when man looked upon reality for the first time.  Their names come to his lips and he smiles as he tastes them, thinking he knows them in the naming.  The thing that has never happened before is still happening.  It is still a miracle.  The great burning blossom squats, flowing upon the limb of the world, excreting the ash of the world, and being none of these things I have named and at the same time all of them, and this is reality-the Nameless. (Zelazny, pp31-33) </p><p>The soliloquy goes on but it becomes more particular to the story, at the surface.  I experienced this particular section as profound.  In reading a biography of William James, I found there were several passages that reminded me of this sermon, within the Zelazny novel.  For instance, in the introduction of the biography is a summary which says the following, “<em>Much of James’s best work is a protest not only against dualism but against what Ian Hacking calls ‘dynamic nominalism’; that is, our habit of creating and naming categories on which we sort ourselves</em>.”  (Richardson, location 76). Like the above extended quotation from the novel, James’ reason for disliking the process of naming things we experience is described, “<em>reality is confined to what we experience</em>.” (Richardson, location 92). He referred to this as “<em>radical empiricism</em>”.  Therefore, secondary sources or descriptive writing or speaking is a less authentic way to know reality than direct experience.  This appears to contradict the adulated, Noam Chomsky. </p><p> “<em>For [Noam] Chomsky the nature of the human mind is revealed by the nature of language.  Not only because language is a uniquely human activity, but also because language ‘is the vehicle of thought’ and therefore uniquely placed to illuminate the essence of the human mind…On this theory, the human mind is endowed- ‘hardwired’ as we have said – with certain innate properties that constrain what we are like and what we can know.</em>” (Stokes, Kindle location 3184)</p><p>The sermon is compatible with William James’ belief in the primacy of actual experience to mental formulation or using speech to regurgitate reality.  It is unlike Chomsky, who believed that our experience of reality was limited to what we could name.  Dr. James would refer to these experiences of a mystical nature as primary.  Secondary sources were the verbal or liturgical communication of the spiritual experience.  The difference would figure prominently in how he constructed <em>The Varieties of Religious Experience, </em>likely his most famous work.  </p><p>“[<em>William James] has no interest, he claims in ‘your ordinary religious believer, who follows the conventional observances of his country, whether it be Buddhist, Christian, Mohammedan.  His religion has been made for him by others, communicated to him by tradition, determined to fixed forms by imitation and retained by habit.’  James was drawn to original or personal religious-or what is now called spiritual-feeling, not to the sociology of religious groups or institutions.</em>” (Richardson, location 7775)</p><p>This is not the only time <em>Lord of Light</em> attempts to address mysticism and its innate resistance to description of language or its its limited accessibility to humanity, through narration as opposed to experience.  In another place, mysteries are contemplated by the secondary hero of the novel, Yama.  Yama is the name of the Hindu God of Death, and the grandchild of the original colonists.  He is given a relatively pedestrian history by Roger Zelazny.</p><p>“’Here me country cousin.’ Said Jan.  ‘Do you remember a snot-nosed brat of dubious parentage, third generation, named Yama?  The kid who was always souping up generators, until one day one blew and he was so badly burned that he got his second body-over fifty years old-when he was only sixteen?  The kid who loved weapons?  The fellow who anesthetized one of everything that moves out there and dissected it, taking such pleasure in his studies that we called him deathgod?’</p><p>‘Yes, I recall him.  Is he still alive?’</p><p>‘If you want to call it that.  He now is deathgod-not by nickname, but by title.’” (Zelazny, p55)</p><p>Many lives of normal men later, but earlier in the book the adult Yama shares his own view of the mystical.  He seems to suggest that there is a more ephemeral reality, outside the reach of reasoning of man.  Yama is speaking to an ape, a reincarnated man and disgraced God.  The ape was sent to follow the hero of the book and false Buddha, Sam.  Sam was observed playing a prolonged game of wagering with one of the original and native inhabitants of the planet.  The creature and antagonist gambler was able to assume the form of a living body, but was in fact a creature made from disembodied energy.  As one of the native inhabitants of the planet, Sam’s gambling antagonist knew of the false Buddha’s role in the forced colonization of the world.</p><p>“<em>’Then the one called Raltariki is really a demon?’ asked Tak [the ape/God].</em></p><p><em>‘Yes-and no,’ said Yama.  ‘If by “demon” you mean a malefic, supernatural creature, possessed of great powers, life span and the ability to temporarily assume virtually any shape-then the answer is no.  This is the generally accepted definition but it is untrue in one respect.’</em></p><p><em>‘Oh? And what may that be?’</em></p><p><em>‘It is not a supernatural creature.’</em></p><p><em>‘But it is all those other things?’</em></p><p><em>‘Yes.’</em></p><p><em>‘Then I fail to see what difference it makes whether it be supernatural or not-so long as it is malefic, possesses great powers and life span and has the ability to change its shape at will.’</em></p><p><em>‘Ah, but it makes a great deal of difference, you see.  It is the difference between the unknown and the unknowable, between science and fantasy-it is a matter of essence.</em>’” (Zelazny, p20)</p><p>Yama goes on to say, “<em>I may submit to the unknown, but never to the unknowable.</em>” (Zelazny, p20)</p><p>The author appears to be making the case for philosophical pluralism or at least Dualism, described by The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy like this, <em>“…a philosophical perspective on the world that emphasizes diversity rather than homogeneity…</em>” (Audi, p714)  He is not suggesting that the “<em>unknowable</em>” does not exist, only that it is outside of mankind’s rational inquiry.  He does appear to be suggesting that the boundaries between the unknowable and the unknown provide more territory to the unknowable than is warranted.  It also increases the dimensionality of Yama by demonstrating his growth beyond a seemingly mundane origin.</p><p>A second area of <em>Lord of </em>Light and its philosophical rumination is known as the mind-body problem. (Horgan). I would illustrate it as follows:  I think I’m me.  That statement echoes the words of René Descartes, ”<em>I think and therefore, I am.</em>”  I can think about my earliest memories.  I think the me as a child is the same the me of today – in spite of differences.  I remember being in high-school.  That’s me, too.  I remember being a young adult, when I got married, became a father, even key milestones in my career.  All of these are part of my enduring sense of self.  If I look in the mirror, that’s me.  If I lose a finger in an accident with a table saw, I still exist.  But, if I lost a finger, no one would think, the finger lost its man.</p><p>In <em>50 Philosophy Ideas You Really Need to Know</em>, Ben Dupré, the author describes the problem above as follows: A person takes their car for repairs.  The presumed broken parts are removed and replaced with new ones.  This process happens many times until eventually, all of the parts have been replaced and the car is made up of all new parts.  Is it the same car or a different car?  What if the parts removed were really working and the repair man built a second car out of the parts taken from the first?  Is the rebuilt car from original parts the owner’s car?  Or, the one he retained, made entirely of new parts? (Dupré, p40-43). If all of cells that make up my body are replaced from the time I am a small child, consistent with my earliest memories, even if I feel like I’m the same person, am I?  The author of <em>50 Philosophy Ideas</em> enhances the dilemma.</p><p><em> “Taking a psychological approach to the question of personal identity, rather than a biological or physical one, let’s suppose that each part of my psychological history is joined to earlier parts by strands of enduring memories, beliefs, etc.  Not all (and perhaps none) of these need extend from start to finish; provided there is a single overlapping lattice of such elements, then it remains my history.  I remain me…It is the dominant theory among contemporary philosophers, but not without problems of its own…</em></p><p><em>Such mixed intuitions may come from asking the wrong questions, or applying the wrong concepts in answering them.  David Hume drew attention to the elusiveness of the self, claiming however hard you look in on yourself, you can only ever detect individual thoughts, memories, experiences.  While it is natural to imagine a substantial self that is the subject of these thoughts, he argues this is wrong – the self is no more than the point of view that makes sense of our thoughts and experiences, but cannot itself be given in them.” (Dupr</em>é,<em>, pp42,43)</em>	</p><p>	Roger Zelazny illustrates the idea of an enduring sense of self in <em>Lord of Light</em> in several places.  In another scene, Sam has decided to free one of the disembodied, energy-based, intelligent natives of the planet the he himself had imprisoned, when originally colonizing the planet.  He finds the leader, having a conversation.  The imprisoned, aborigine speaks first.</p><p><em>“’So, Hated One, you have returned!’</em></p><p><em>The words fell upon him [Sam] like whiplashes.  Steadying himself, he faced the blue flame then and replied:</em></p><p><em>‘You’re called Taraka?’</em></p><p><em>‘He who bound me here should know what I am called,’ came the words.  ‘Think not, oh Siddhartha [Sam], that because you were a different body you go now unrecognized.  I look upon the flows of energy which are your real being – not the flesh that masks them.’”</em></p><p>So – we have a statement that our mind is not our body but does contain our essence.  Francis Crick, of DNA double-helix fame eloquently states an opposing <em>materialist</em> point of view that the mind is a product of the brain in his book, <em>The Astonishing Hypothesis</em>.  “<em>The astonishing hypothesis is that ‘You,’ your joys and your sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will, are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules.</em>” (Crick, p3).  Early in <em>Lord of </em>Light, Zelazny addresses this issue in a way that I found very surprising.  It is neither consistent with the dualists, like Descartes.  But, it is not like the materialists such as Crick.</p><p>“The power of most of the gods [colonists], however, is predicated upon a special physiology, which they lose in part when incarnated into a new body.  The mind, somehow remembering, after a time alters any body to a certain extent, engendering new homeostasis, permitting a gradual return to power.” (Zelazny, pp13, 14)</p><p>And later, while Yama is an enemy of Sam, they discuss the mind-body problem as portrayed within the novel.</p><p>“<em>’It is amazing,’ he [Sam] said, ‘how that mutant brain of yours generated a mind capable of transferring its powers to any new brain you choose to occupy…No matter what body I inhabit, it appears that my power follows me into it, also…I have often wondered as to the physiological basis for the phenomenon.  Have you researched the area?’</em></p><p><em>‘Yes,’ said Yama, his eyes burning beneath his dark brows.</em></p><p><em>‘And what is the explanation? A person is born with an abnormal brain, his psyche is later transferred to a normal one and yet his abnormal abilities are not destroyed in the transfer.  Why does this thing happen?’</em></p><p><em>‘Because you really have only one body-image, which is electrical as well as chemical in nature.  It begins immediately to modify its new physiological environment.  The new body has much about it which it treats rather like a disease, attempting to cure it into being the old body.  If the body which you now inhabit were to be made physically immortal, it would someday come to resemble your original body.</em>’” (Zelazny, pp 116, 117)</p><p>Here, Roger Zelazny  shows himself also to be a materialist or monist because he is suggesting the mind imposes an identity upon the body, creating an enduring sense of self.  Because mind can physically change the brain / body, they must be made of the same stuff - matter.  The enduring self as part of the mind, irrespective of the container in which it was held would generally make me assume dualism.  I would conclude from the discussion of the unknown versus the unknowable that Zelazny would be a dualist.  But, that presumes that the spirit or mind is something different than matter or the body.  Here, he claims that the mind is what is real and it has dominance over matter.  There are many other scenes that are seemingly requisite for the progress of this tale.  This adventure has fighting and something like magic but also examines the ideas of personhood, good and evil and free-will.</p><p>	As much fun as this book is to read today, it was first published in 1967 and shows some of the stereotypes as well as prejudices around gender and sexual orientation that more contemporaneous works appear to have left behind.  One of the original colonists, a female has become a male God because she is a lesbian and wants a harem.  But, the women of the harem are interested in another of the colonists, who was born a male and continues to reincarnate as male.  Yama ultimately marries a female, who reincarnates as a male, ending the marriage.  The female, who changed her body into that of a male, later voices a desire to be a woman because of her longing to return to her intrinsic femininity.  These ideas of sexuality do not hold in today’s science or society.  I do not hold this against the author, seeing him as a product of his times.  But, it does erode the believability of the story and reduces my interest in it.  In that sense, it is like watching a song I remembered as being great from an early era of music videos.  When I chance upon the video or watch it on the internet, I may see the teased hair of the band and see the stereotypes of the “extras” and I realize that the song has a context, just as this book.  But the change in context renders parts of the story irrelevant.</p><p>	It is likely I will read the book many more times in the upcoming years.  I read it for fun and entertainment.  I ponder the injection into the plot of so many areas of erudition which I have wondered, independently of the story.  I occasionally wince at the components which have not aged well or that embarrass me because society has passed them.  But, I do love the book.</p><p>REFERENCES:</p><p>Audi, Robert.&nbsp;<em>The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy</em>. 2nd ed., Cambridge University Press, 1999.</p><p>“Clarke's Three Laws.” Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, 3 July 2018, en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_three_laws.</p><p>Crick, Francis.&nbsp;<em>The Astonishing Hypothesis: the Scientific Search for the Soul</em>.
