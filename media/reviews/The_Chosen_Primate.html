<h2>Title: The Chosen Primate: Human Nature and Cultural Diversity</h2><p>Author: Adam Kuper</p><p>Publisher: Harvard University Press – Cambridge, MA/London, England</p><p>Date: 1994 (Paperback edition reviewed: 1996)</p><p>While I have always been fast and loose with the facts, making audacious statements about the nature of objective reality on tidbits of evidence, I have always been intolerant of others who shared my habit of self-selecting to the company of the grand and grandiose. The Chosen Primate by Adam Kuper is a wonderful review of the state of thinking, concerning social biology and the biological roots of culture. It deals with the great questions about humanity and its nature, but only carefully and incrementally does it reach conclusions. Indeed, the book might seem frightfully unsatisfying to some with its lack of strong earth shattering statements, given its continual dialog about the questions antecedent to those statements and its review of the relevant authors and evidence. But, such careful consideration of the available evidence and dismissal of glib pronouncements of authors whose vision has out sped the findings of the field workers is precisely what I have found satisfying. My own views on sociobiology, developed without the aids of professors, to warn me of presumption take several broadside hits. The skill and organization used by the author to present the data make the battering of my personal positions of small consequence.</p><p>The Chosen Primate is a review of recent articles and corollary, and especially historical material, which the author, Adam Kuper came across while editing Current Anthropology.</p><p>&quot;Between 1985 and 1993 I served as editor of Current Anthropology, an international, interdisciplinary anthropological journal that is one of the main arenas for theoretical debates in the field. I was plunged into a series of interlinked conversations on the history of the species and on human cultural diversity, becoming a sort of ethnographer of anthropology.</p><p>&quot;It was a period of intellectual ferment. Theoretical debate was alive and well, and the issues were more complex than the radicals of either party would readily concede. The arguments were fresh and urgent. The papers I read spilled over with evidence and ideas that demanded a fundamental rethinking of some of the central questions in the anthropological tradition.</p><p>&quot;I immediately began to look around for a book that would review the state of play for me, but I could not find one. There are good textbooks in particular fields, but few modern syntheses; and there are far too many prophets about, each possessed by a Big Idea…&quot; (p viii)</p><p>This book provides enough background to recognize historical precedent in the development of current ideas in the debate. It has appeared to be even handed, granting no author a &quot;by,&quot; but demonstrating mercilessness to those whom overreach. The book is broken into chapters, each, which deal with a particular set of arguments or concerns.</p><p>Chapter One: All Darwinians Now? Pronounces the victory of &quot;natural selection&quot; among biologists. &quot;…the primate origin of humanity, has been abundantly supported, most recently by the discovery that humans and chimpanzees are identical in 98.4 percent of the DNA nucleotide sequences and in 99.6 percent of their amino-acid sequences.&quot; (p4) In this chapter, Mr. Kuper reviews the relevant history and retells the oft-told story of Lamarck, Charles Darwin’s incorrect predecessor theorist of change in species. He briefly mentions Alfred Russell Wallace, who nearly beat Mr. Darwin to the punch. Adam Kuper notes Darwin’s fear over the reaction to his theories and the temporary limbo of Darwinism because the mechanics of heritable traits were not understood. Eventually, he tells of the re-discovery of Gregory Mendel’s prescient theory of genetics and the icing on the cake – the discovery of DNA by Crick and Watson.</p><p>It is in this chapter that Mr. Kuper begins illumination of the archetypal positions on biology and behavior. The first point of view is that human behavior can be understood as an extreme example of primate behavior and its existence can be seen as nearly deterministic with evolution as its shaping force. &quot;Human behavior is therefore a modification of the habits of other apes.&quot; (p4) For evidence of famous proponents of this point of view, he mentions Desmond Morris and his now famous phrase &quot;naked ape.&quot; (p5) Additionally, Adam Kuper identifies a group of ideologues. &quot;…the pacemakers of the biological party have been a rampant radical faction, the sociobiologists, who have been inspired by the great advances in human genetics.&quot; (p5)</p><p>The second seminal point of view, discussed by Adam Kuper is that of people whom believe that biology and evolution cannot adequately explain the complexity of human creativity and culture. &quot;…those who emphasize the unique roll of learning…Culture is a uniquely human achievement, and it is simply perverse to deny the distinctiveness and significance of the cultural factor in human history. The culture school has its contemporary radicals too, the ultra-relativists, who emphasize the uniqueness of every culture and the power of cultures to shape the mind.&quot; (pp 5,6)</p><p>With its beginning outline of conflict between the traditional positions of the social sciences and the encroachment of their territory by behavioral biology, Mr. Kuper sets the stage for much of the rest of the book. Only at the end of the chapter does he begin to stake out his position as mediator and judge. He does this by attacking sloppy use of the underlying science to make broad generalizations. &quot;Social Darwinists in the twentieth century argued that races and nations were like natural species, and were inevitably engaged in a natural struggle for domination, from which the fittest would emerge triumphant…This was largely a perversion of Darwinian thought. One of Darwin’s decisive insights was that selective pressures operate on individuals.&quot; (p14) Near the close of the chapter is his strongest statement on this issue, &quot;In the twentieth century, Darwin’s name has been used to justify virtually every political position in the spectrum, which suggests that his theory does not necessarily sanction any particular social philosophy.&quot; (p17)</p><p>The second chapter is: To Begin at the Beginning. It accomplishes three things. The first is a recount of modern anthropology, from Darwin, through Chris Stringer. The second is a brief recap of the finds of the last 100 years. The third is his continued emphasis on the difficulty of deciding what characteristics are human. &quot;Although some purists would prefer to consider morphology and behavior separately, changes in behavior and morphology are usually tied together in evolutionary narratives.&quot; (p21)</p><p>Adam Kuper is not particularly kind to the fossil hunters who dig up our past. First he describes their problems. &quot;The absolute number of ancient human fossils out there is probably not very great, and if ancient fossils are found, they are likely to be fragmentary.&quot; (p26) Then later, &quot;To make matters more complicated, there were almost certainly several lines of hominid evolution, one leading to Homo sapiens.&quot; [Italics in the original.] (p27) But then he offers a backhanded compliment. &quot;Fossil hunters are often visionaries, mavericks, publicists-independent operators with great faith in their own intuitions. Some exhibit proprietorial pride in the fossils they discover and persuade themselves that they have unique insights into their characters.&quot; (p27)</p><p>The chapter describes the finding of Neanderthal Man in the Neander Valley in 1856; (p27) the finding of Homo Erectus in the forms of Java man, in 1894 and Peking man, in 1929. (pp29, 30) Mr. Kuper discusses Raymond Dart’s find of the &quot;Taung baby&quot; in 1925, later identified as Australopithecus africanus. The author relates a good deal of space to the fraud of &quot;Piltdown Man.&quot; (pp30-38) Reluctant to give Louis Leakey credit for anything except tenacity, Adam Kuper tells of Mary Leakey’s find of Australopithecus boisei, in 1959. (Louis named it after a benefactor.) (p41) Next to be described is Homo habilis, found by Louis’ youngest son. &quot;…the Leakey family had meanwhile discovered yet another candidate for an ancient human forebear... Jonathan, only nineteen years old and just out of school. Wandering around Olduvai in May 1960, he came upon some bones and teeth that apparently belonged to a large-brained human creature. Geologists were on hand, and they fixed the date of the site at 1.7 million years old. A promising feature was that the fossils were associated with forty-eight stone artifacts [tools].&quot; (p44) Homo habilis means &quot;handy man.&quot;</p><p>Another incredible find was &quot;Lucy,&quot; by Donald Johanson in 1974. &quot;Lucy was important because she was virtually intact. This was the only complete skeleton that had been found of any fossil human older than the Neanderthals. She had died at the age of about 25, some 3.5 million years ago.&quot; (p45) Finally, he mentions the footprints found by Mary Leakey in 1978-79, in Laetoli. (p47) He does not mention that they were of two adults and a child, walking through wet volcanic ash. Mary herself had commented on and found quite touching the possibility that this was a father, mother and child walking alone, millions of years ago.</p><p>Throughout the chapter, he weaves in the importance of the finds to answering the question, what is human? Is it our large brain? Homo habilis has a very wide range of cranial capacity and Neanderthal’s average is greater than ours. (Cranial capacity is often used as a surrogate for measuring brain size.) Is it language? &quot;There is some evidence to suggest that even archaic Homo sapiens lacked the physical equipment to speak modern languages.&quot; (p25) Is it physical structure? He paraphrases Ernst Mayr. &quot;All a morphologist could rightly say was that Homo is characterized by upright posture…&quot; (p24) He foreshadows where the narrative within the chapter is going, by telling us the meaning of the following pages. &quot;…the morphological criteria are inconclusive, and there is no obvious behavioral criterion that marks off all species of Homo.&quot;</p><p>Chapter 3 is A Human Way of Life and introduces us to the great ethnographic studies of the 60’s and 70’s. Sherwood Washburn, was a physical anthropologist and professor of anthropology at the University of California in Berkeley, during the same period of time. He organized a field study of baboons by social anthropologist, Irven DeVore. According to Adam Kuper, Mr. DeVore’s conclusions were that males were dominance oriented, much larger than females and that baboon troops were very stable. Other studies identified gorillas as belonging to smaller groups and dominated by a single large silverback. Most primates were herbivorous. However, chimpanzees occasionally hunted monkeys. (Jane Goodall, discovered this and gives an excellent, accessible account in &quot;In the Shadow of Man.&quot;)</p><p>Then, in an attempt to understand the behavior of the hunter-gatherers of prehistory, another study was organized and encouraged by Professor Washburn. This time the ethnograph would be of the Kalahari Bushmen called the !Kung. (An exclamation ! stands for a clicking sound, made by quickly drawing the tongue away from the palette. The sound is used in the language of the !Kung.) One of the findings was that the !Kung lived a &quot;comfortable existence&quot; (p67) in spite of their living in a marginal geography. Both men and women gathered food, but only men hunted. The conclusions drawn became the basis of controversy. Adam Kuper labels the two camps in this controversy as &quot;Man the Hunter&quot; and &quot;Woman the Gatherer.&quot; The man the hunter group believed that hunting was the unique characteristic, which defined man from other primates. However, more recent information seems to indicate that &quot;man the scavenger&quot; would be a more accurate nomen. The woman the gatherer group emphasized the personal independence of women in the prehistory of humankind, as well as their dominating contribution to socialization and food-sharing. They considered those traits as the cultural precursors to modern humanity. However, comparisons with that view and our closest primate relatives or modern hunter-gatherers seem to point out a more complicated situation. Males are dominant in chimpanzee society, even if females feed themselves and their young. However, females are dominant in feeding among Bonobos. (See Frans DeWaal's &quot;Bonobo: The Forgotten Ape.&quot;) Additionally, while gathering creates the majority of calories for most hunter-gatherer groups, when hunting is successful, it brings in many rapidly decaying calories, typically shared by all. Additionally, &quot;The earliest human campsites revealed evidence of meat-eating.&quot; (pp70,71)</p><p>Finally, Mr. Kuper points out that human society shows repeatedly two characteristics, which are mutually exclusive in all other primate societies. &quot;Among other primates, there seems to be a necessary choice. Either the social unit is based on a monogamous couple (as among gibbons or orangutans), in which case they live in isolation; or else there is a community, and that is dominated by a male who monopolizes resident females (as among gorillas) or by a group of males who share access to females (as among chimpanzees and baboons). If there is a community, then monogamy is absent-except among human beings. Only humans combine two forms of organization: the stable married pair and the band.&quot; (p77) One of the interesting points here, skipped over by Adam Kuper is that when sexual dimorphism exists, there is always a dominant sex. That is no species has been found with differing average sizes between males and females, in which the larger sex isn't dominant in the society of that species. In the lineage assumed to lead to Homo sapiens, Australopithecus to Homo habilis, Homo habilis to Homo erectus, erectus to us – dimorphism increases to nearly the extremes of gorillas in H. habilis. This would suggest increasing male competition for females and dominance in Homo society. It may also indicate increasingly scarce and diversely distributed food supplies. However, the dimorphism diminishes to the present, where males are about 15% larger than females. I believe this suggests that we carry in our genes the biological roots of alternative social organizations. Such a discussion does not come up within the chapter.</p><p>The Evolution of Culture, chapter 4 quotes Richard Klein of the University of Chicago in its first paragraph. ‘&quot;Prior to the emergence of modern people, the human form and human behavior evolved together slowly, hand in hand. Afterward, fundamental evolutionary change in body form ceased, while behavioral (cultural) evolution accelerated dramatically.&quot;’ (p79) With this, Adam Kuper criticizes the social biology group. He goes on to briefly describe the findings of human culture and its relevant timetable.</p><p>Mr. Kuper, paraphrasing the work of Philip Chase and Harold Dibble undermines the idea of sophisticated Neanderthal culture. &quot;Neanderthals may not even have been able to make fire, though there is evidence of controlled fire use from a much earlier stage of human history; and the hearth does not seem to have become a focus of activity. The Neanderthals did not perform rituals and did not bury their dead. Their took-kit changed little over the millennia, and they did not make tools with several parts, such as hafted spears or harpoons, and rarely used bone, antler, or ivory as materials.&quot; (p81) This is in direct contradiction to the once popular interpretation of Neanderthal finds, where pollen found with a body was assumed to be flowers buried with a lost loved one. On such findings, popular novels and movies such as &quot;Clan of the Cave Bear&quot; were based. Adam Kuper mentions that only one site associated with &quot;Upper Paleolithic&quot; [late stone age] technology has been associated with Neanderthals, Saint-C’esaire in France.</p><p>The author spends a fair amount of time on what others have referred to as the &quot;cultural revolution,&quot; and highlights the opinion of Lewis Binford. &quot;…the great spurt of cultural creativity some 45,000 years ago corresponded to the development of language.&quot; (p82) Mr. Kuper goes on to emphasize how it was an event which was not participated in by the Neanderthals. In that sense, he appears to be part of the mainstream of human origins researchers, supporting the view that Homo sapiens came from Africa recently - replacing all previously migrated human species. This is an important controversy, though Adam Kuper does not mention Professor Milford Wolpoff of Michigan State, an animated opponent to the idea that: Neanderthals were displaced by Cro-Magnon (Homo sapiens) without leaving offspring. Mr. Kuper again criticizes the biological behaviorist camp. The heart of his argument is that while physical changes in the species have stopped, our culture has grown increasingly diverse. &quot;The hiatus between the evolution of modern humans and the development of culture leads to a conclusion that is of pivotal importance for this book. Physical evolution and cultural development did not march hand in hand…Perhaps we should even rethink the established view that the first use of tools, some two million years ago, signaled the evolution of a new species, Homo habilis. [Italics in the original] Certainly the biological evidence for this speciation event is not conclusive.&quot; (p90)</p><p>The last ten pages of the chapter are dedicated to the last ten thousand years of history. He asserts this second wave of culture, referred to as the &quot;Neolithic Revolution&quot; as not being a revolution at all, but a continuous upgrade in technology. Agriculture in particular, he points out may have started ten-thousand years ago, in the near east, but only reached America two-thousand years ago, eight-thousand after its beginning. The most interesting quote to me from the section – &quot;The writers of the Book of Genesis were living in one of the most sophisticated regions in the world, even by the standards of the next two thousand years.&quot; He closes the chapter by dismissing various &quot;theories of history,&quot; including Karl Marx. Essentially, his argument is that not all cultural developments are useful and have meaning outside of the culture in which they exist. He refers those who believe so, as &quot;cultural functionalists&quot; and he states they are wrong.</p><p>Cultivating the Species is chapter 5 and deals with two topics; eugenics and intelligence testing. There are two important books, in particular that deal with intelligence that I would have like to have read prior to reading this chapter. The first is The Mismeasure of Man by the eminent Stephan Jay Gould. The other is The Bell Curve by Richard J. Hernstein and Charles Murray. The first is reputed to be an iconoclastic look at what anthropology has to say about intelligence. The second, accused of being racist is an attempt to classify the various social and racial groups by intelligence, supposedly using statistical methods.</p><p>&quot;There are no neutral theories about human beings,&quot; wrote Adam Kuper. &quot;Each carries a charge that can ignite a political program. Theories of human evolution are particularly potent, for they suggest that it might be possible to steer progress, to help change along.&quot; (p102) Thus, the author leads us to Karl Marx, who sent Charles Darwin an inscribed copy of Das Kapital. Mr. Kuper notes that both Darwin and Alfred Wallace believed that all races of humanity were part of the same species, but that they also believed the apparent ascendance of Europeans was evidence of their intellectual superiority.</p><p>According to Adam Kuper, Charles Darwin had previously observed the unfitness of most domesticated animals for survival, in the wild. He believed that mankind, by virtue of its self-induced domestication and as the result of mate selection could destroy the progress of evolution and natural selection in the creation of the human species. ‘ &quot;Man scans with scrupulous care the character and pedigree of his horses, cattle, and dogs before he matches them,&quot; Darwin complained. &quot;but, when he comes to his own marriage he rarely, or never takes any such care. He is impelled by nearly the same motives as the lower animals.&quot;’ (pp 105, 106) Thus Darwin and Wallace worried about the loss of on-going benefits to be derived from natural selection among humans. Wallace however, saw an opportunity – to rationally plan and improve humanity. Since it was our species’ brain that made us dominant among all the animal kingdom, you must improve the brain and the human intellect to improve the species.</p><p>Next the book dedicates several pages to Francis Galton, Charles Darwin’s younger cousin. He was a statistician, believer in evolution and the founder of eugenics. According to Mr. Kuper, eugenics is &quot;the movement that advocated controlled breeding of human beings in order to improve the intellectual and moral quality of populations.&quot; (p110) A protégé of Francis Galton named Karl Pearson began to systematically have teachers assess the work of their students. His conclusions - intelligence ran in families, with siblings scoring similarly in intellectual tasks.</p><p>Adam Kuper documents the testing of intelligence. Alfred Binet, who devised tests to identify students in need of special assistance in their education, is named. The entire U.S. psychology community is indicted in its obsession with intelligence testing, including and especially Lewis M. Terman, a Stanford psychologist who developed the Stanford-Binet standardized test. The U.S. Army allowed the testing of 1.75 million men. This was later used in an attempt to establish the intellectual superiority of northern Europeans over southern Europeans and Slavs. (p116)</p><p>According to Mr. Kuper, many people became taken with eugenics including President Coolidge and Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. (p119) &quot;In some parts of the south, enthusiastic sheriffs would round up ‘hillbillies’ who seemed to them to be unfit, and have them sterilized in batches in the hospitals. In one year alone (1941), 36,000 Americans were sterilized by the authorities.&quot; (p119) The movement reaches its peak with the Nazis. Cyril Burt, another prominent British scientist who advocated eugenics and perpetuated the theory by publishing the most extensive studies of monozygotic (identical) twins eventually had his work to be demonstrated as being fraudulent by a variety of people, including Leon Kamin, Oliver Gillie and one-time supporter, psychologist L.S. Hearnshaw. Adam Kuper closes the chapter by discussing a variety of studies seeming to contradict the idea of heritable intelligence. One quote I thought important &quot;’about 85 per cent of human genetic variation (measured by any of a number of common statistics) is between individuals within a population (that is nation or tribe). Only about 5 per cent is between races.’&quot; (p121) Another fascinating quote is this: &quot;the average IQ score of adopted children is 12 points higher if their foster parents enjoy a high rather than a low socioeconomic status…this is clearly a purely environmental effect.&quot; (p127)</p><p>Chapter 6, The Common Heritage demonstrates Adam Kuper’s dissatisfaction with the tenants of sociobiology, by demonstrating the theoretical similarity between its modern version, which was published in Sociobiology: The New Synthesis by E.O. Wilson and ethology, a European 1930s attempt to understand animal behavior in the context of Darwinian selection. He goes on to demonstrate the sympathy one of the founding ethologists, Konrad Lorenz had for Nazi goals. This is a clear case of poisoning the well, and is not characteristic of most of The Chosen Primate.</p><p>The most common behavioral characteristics attempted to be demonstrably genetic, according to Mr. Kuper is aggression and territoriality. The author speaks highly of Robin Fox, an anthropologist who was sympathetic to socio-biological / ethological views, but who had &quot;a rare command of the evidence from cultural anthropology [and]…cultivated awareness of the philosophical roots of the debates between the proponents of an innate human nature and their opponents.&quot; (p133) Adam Kuper claims Robin Fox romanticized the Paleolithic era in human history and believed that modern culture and society was a poor fit for man’s true nature, which had evolved under very different conditions than western urbanism.</p><p>During the author’s repudiation of many of the claims of sociobiology, he makes an interesting statement, and again quotes the prominent Stephan Jay Gould: ‘&quot;What is the direct evidence for genetic control of specific human social behavior?…At the moment, the answer is none whatever.&quot; Fifteen years later, the same answer must be returned, but nobody is surprised any longer.’ (p136) In contradiction to Adam Kuper, there are two examples, which come to mind. One is the recent finding of a specific gene associated with schizophrenia. Assuming that schizophrenia is in fact a definable illness on the basis of behavioral symptoms, this appears to contradict Mr. Kuper. The second is the comparison of brain anatomy of male homosexuals with the brains of male heterosexuals. If we assume cranio-neural anatomy to be primarily an expression of genetic material, then it too appears to contradict at least generally the beliefs of Mr. Kuper. (In all fairness to Mr. Kuper, that last study has been criticized on various grounds, most importantly on the size of the sample.) Nevertheless, Mr. Kuper spends several pages attacking sociobiology. &quot;The evidence for territorial behavior among humans is by no means unambiguous, and on any definition the degree of territoriality is very variable.&quot; (p141)</p><p>The most interesting material to me occurs at the end of the chapter, where Adam Kuper discusses the work of Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza. Mr. Kuper states Cavalli-Sforza initially attempted to use blood typing, then later DNA to trace the great migrations of Homo sapiens around the world. &quot;One spectacular finding was that the genetic distance between Africans and non-Africans is twice that between Asians and Australians, which in turn is twice that between Asians and Europeans. This is precisely what would be expected if modern humans originated in Africa…[and] Asians and Europeans had separated from one another comparatively recently…Australians had separated from Asians at much the same time, but had lived in isolation since then.&quot; (p149) Mr. Cavalli-Sforza went on to work with Stanford linguist Joseph Greenberg and matched Mr. Greenberg’s once controversial language family maps to the various genetic groups in an effort to reinforce his conclusions about the epic migrations of humanity. Their point was that distance between language groups correlated with genetic distance. The chapter closes by introducing us to Richard Dawkin’s term &quot;memes&quot; the cultural equivalent of genes, a single unit of cultural structure or information. Much of the end of this chapter is Adam Kuper demonstrating the contradictions and problems with both the concept of a &quot;meme&quot; and its divergence from actual genetic transmission, the term's analogical parent.</p><p>First Family, chapter 7 is about the origins of the family. It is a significant topic for anthropology because of a web of historical beliefs concerning cultural behaviors, which set humans apart. The formation of the family was thought to be one of those unique cultural behaviors. The incest taboo is another. According to Adam Kuper, anthropologists thought them related, as governors of the sex instinct. Speculation about the pre-family, sex habits of humanity or its evolutionary predecessors was prurient among 19th century scientists. Popularly, scientists within the anthropological arena believed ancient man to have been shockingly promiscuous. This chapter outlines three basic views from the 19th and early 20th centuries, concerning these practices.</p><p>Mr. Kuper identifies Darwin himself as being skeptical about the licentiousness of ancient man. Relying on Gorillas, then believed to be the likely closest relative of man, Adam Kuper claims that Darwin thought our ancestors to have had a similarly arranged society. Our species would be organized around small families dominated by a single large adult male. A Finnish scholar, Edward Westermarck, buttressed Charles Darwin's ideas. However, Mr. Westermarck went on to conclude that incest avoidance was likely part of primates, in general. Adam Kuper quotes him, '&quot;Human marriage appears, then, to be an inheritance from some ape-like progenitor.&quot;' (p158) Further, the author outlines &quot;[t]wo modern studies [which] provide support for Westermarck's central thesis. The first one focused on the kibbutz, a utopian socialist invention of the first Zionist settlers in Israel in the 1920s…Children were therefore raised communally. Age-mates lived together, in collective nurseries and boarding houses…Nevertheless, children brought up together from infancy under these conditions were extremely unlikely to form sexual relationships at adolescence…Joseph Sepher, analyzed material on 2,769 marriages from 211 kibbutzim. Only 14 of these marriages involved a couple who had brought up in the same peer group and only a handful of these couples had been in the same peer group from under the age of five. Sepher argued that his findings provided 'a strong case for Westermarck's instinctive avoidance theory.'&quot; (p159)</p><p>In 1913, Sigmund Freud proposed the second theory of incest avoidance discussed, within the chapter. According to Adam Kuper, Dr. Freud believed that all male children were attracted to their mothers. But, healthy sons redirected their &quot;sexual interest to persons of the opposite sex outside the family.&quot; (p160) &quot;In Freud's theory, culture normally triumphs over nature…In Westermarck's theory, culture follows nature.&quot; (p162) Mr. Kuper states that the evidence favors Westermarck over Sigmund Freud.</p><p>A final theory of incest avoidance iterated by the author, was the work of Claude Levi-Strauss. It was a theory based on exchange and tribal relationships. Wives were the glue, maintaining social cohesion. Daughters could be given to the sons of allies or the members of other clans or tribes. The children from such arrangements may be exchanged again, renewing social bonds on a periodic basis.</p><p>One thing, which troubled me during this chapter, was my belief that incest avoidance was not a modern Homo sapien trait. It was not until twelve pages into the chapter that the author gets to that point.</p><p>&quot;One thing all these theories of incest regulation had in common was the premise that the taboo on incest distinguished human beings from all other animals. This assumption was based on observations of domestic animals and of the denizens of zoos. Solly Zuckerman, studying primates in the London Zoo in the 1920s and 1930s, even found an incestuous mother-son pair. Apparently, therefore, incest avoidance was a uniquely human trait.</p><p>&quot;As it turns out, this conclusion was false. Incestuous sexual contact is uncommon among most animals in nature. Generally, maturing males are expelled from the home group and are obliged to seek partners elsewhere…Even where opportunities for incestuous mating exist, it may not occur. George Schaller found that in a gorilla band, a young female will not mate with its father or brother. Ironically, theories about incest and human culture were based on a contrast between humans and incestuous domesticated animals. This distinction vanished if humans were compared with animals in the wild.&quot; (p166)</p><p>If a behavior is universal among members of a species, it likely biologically mandated. The inference is that if a behavior is not ubiquitous within a species, it is unlikely to be biological in nature. The remainder of the chapter is spent undermining the universality of family characteristics and mating behavior among humans. Societies where the brother of the wife lead the family and are responsible for the rearing of children, polygamous family structures, matrilineal societies, even ones in Africa, where women can have multiple wives (no that isn't a misprint) or be married to men who are currently deceased are all given as examples of the flexibility of the family as a cultural institution. &quot;In short, the family may be universal but it is a flexible institution, its internal arrangements adapted to the structure of the broader society, its breeding policies responsive to economic signals.&quot; (p 178)</p><p>Adam Kuper, showing continued skepticism over the claims of sociobiology uses the clearest example of diverse biology and inter-changeable, culturally malleable behavior in chapter 8, Male and Female. In this chapter, he recapitulates much of the work, which demonstrates the range of acceptable sex ordained behavior in various cultures. Early in the chapter he introduces us to &quot;the father figure of American anthropology&quot;, (p 179) Franz Boas. Mr. Boas is treated particularly leniently, as is his disdain for ethology. Mr. Kuper implies that Franz Boas' strong anti-racism is because sociobiology and ethology often become rationalization for racist attitudes. Nevertheless, most of the chapter is spent sharing the history of Professor Boas' most famous student, Margaret Mead.</p><p>The author notes many of Margaret Mead's shortcomings. For instance, in her first trip to Somoa, she decided to not live with a Somoan family. &quot;This is a choice that would not be acceptable to a later, more purist generation of fieldworkers.&quot; (p183) It is with some surprise that Adam Kuper mentions Margaret Mead as having another woman as a lover. It is so devoid of context, that one can only hope that it is an attempt to explain Margaret's iconoclastic work on gender roles. (He also writes about two of Ms. Mead's husbands.) Using several different cultures within Somoa, Margaret Mead documents several strongly diverse beliefs about sex specific behavior. The Arapesh was strongly anti-aggression and both sexes were feminized by then early to mid 20th century American standards. In the Iutmal, &quot;they played at other inversions of normal behavior, including incest and homosexuality.&quot; (p188) Many others were discussed. Like a literary pile on, Adam Kuper makes the point that culture can be a dominating influence to individual behavior, in the most obviously biologically defined division within our species, the division of gender. Again, Adam Kuper disregards examples from near human ancestors. The pygmy chimpanzee or Bonobo is discussed with great lucidity and detail in Franz DeWaal's &quot;Bonobo: the Forgotten Ape.&quot; The Bonobo are a very closely related to the Chimpanzee, having broken from that species well after our own break, and thus of equal distance of the Chimpanzee to Homo sapiens. The most interesting behavioral characteristic of the species is its apparent obsession with sex. The mating ameliorates tension and aggression. Male to male, female to male, and adolescents greet each other with quick copulation. It can be incestuous, and surprising to researchers occurs with more than one sexual position.</p><p>The author spends a good deal of space on the question of female equality within the public sphere of society in general, irrespective of culture. &quot;…feminist theorists generally agreed on a radical and fundamental premise…the subjugation of women is universal, but caused by cultural processes rather than by biological determinants.&quot; (p199) Mr. Kuper also documents the growing influence of Marxism in anthropology during the sixties and seventies. Finally, he undermines the arguments of feminists by giving several examples of the societies in which women are not particularly &quot;dominated' by males.</p><p>Much of the rest of the chapter is about the collapse of Margaret Mead's work, in the face of later ethnographers. Some attacks on her were described as &quot;scabrous&quot; (p 193) But, those who followed her and revised the understanding of the cultures she first studied often made the picture more complicated, not less so. Some social and economic organizations strongly lent themselves to gender roles. For instance, hunter-gatherer groups, as has been noted earlier often have the majority of their calories supplied by women. Other socio-economic arrangements led to other sex specific behaviors. Nevertheless, there is no society in which women are dominant. Adam Kuper does not mention, let alone suggest that this may be related to human sexual dimorphism. This seems ridiculous to me. I believe male social dominance in all traditional, human societies is a vestigial arrangement that ought to no longer have a place within modern society. It has been preserved, if only because humans have a propensity to see groups as arranged in hierarchies and the hierarchies as being made up of men. This propensity, I believe is a function of the brain's physical structure, which is primarily genetically determined.</p><p>The Origin of Society is chapter 9. It attempts to document the search for the origins of society, and in that sense, is a larger, reincarnated, concentric to chapter 7 and its focus on the First Family. The chapter begins with a painfully dull overview of some 16th century writers. Hobbes' praise of a strong government was juxtaposed with Roseau's admiration for man's freedom in his natural state. Adam Kuper , then, recounts his first candidate for societal catalyst - blood ties.</p><p>The author holds up Australian aborigines as the first example of a simple society, organized by blood relationships, both matrilineally and patrilineally. The next example was that of the Nuer, a people living on the lower Nile in the Sudan. Their society included many settlements and villages each based roughly on relationship to an ancestor. &quot;Most men in any one village or district could trace a common ancestry. In the tribe itself, the majority could claim a (possibly fictive [parenthesis in the original]) descent from a founding ancestor who was supposed to have lived many generations ago.&quot; (p213) Villages were reportedly willing to defend any individual member against other villages and villagers, even if he instigated the conflict through bad conduct. Villages of more closely related individuals would unite to fight more distantly related villages.</p><p>Again, Mr. Kuper stops us from over-reaching at this point, by pointing out all of the exceptions to the blood-ties rules. Bands and tribes would accept outsiders as members, and individuals may be members of several bands over a lifetime. However, rather than conclude that Adam Kuper has undermined the biological basis for this cultural behavior, I am instead strongly reminded of Jane Goodall's descriptions of the chimpanzees within Tanzania in her two books In the Shadow of Man and Through a Window. Clearly, chimpanzee society is ordered on the dominance of related males. Yet, males can and do change troops. It appears to me that Adam Kuper is using the philosophical notion that a single example contrary to a statement makes the statement untrue. In effect, he is saying that society cannot be organized on the basis of biology, because there is so large a variety of social arrangements, institutions etc.</p><p>Nevertheless, orangutans are solitary creatures. This behavior is rarely excepted and few would argue that it is merely socialization that causes this behavior. Likewise, humans are generally social. Lineage appears to have a major defining role within simple, and primitive societies. We know that it does within chimpanzee society. Why is it such a stretch to suggest this may be part of a common ancestor's behavior?</p><p>On page 216, the author gives an example of chimpanzee violence between troops. This is almost certainly derived from Jane Goodall's work in the previous mentioned books, of which &quot;War&quot; is the chapter title. He again goes on to mention the work of Bruce Knauft and Mr. Knauft's assertion that &quot;Systematic feuding and warfare are characteristic rather of more complex societies.&quot; (p216) I do not have expertise to dispute this, of my own. But, again - Mr. Kuper's description of Margaret Mead's work with the Somoans seems to indicate at least one of the Somoan cultures were in fact, aggressive, and violent with their neighbors.</p><p>The next example for the seminal glue for society given by Adam Kuper is Adam Smith's exchange and specialization for self-interest. Essentially, specialization created advantages for the individual by trading his specialty for other goods and products. But, it also made him dependent on others. Thus, a society formed based on exchanges made on the basis of profit motive and self-interest.</p><p>The author's final example was taken from Marcel Mauss, a French sociologist. Mauss, using the ethnograph of Bronislaw Malinowski, concerning the Trobiand Islanders, postulated that society did form based on exchanges, but that those exchanges were social in origin. They were not based on self-interest as had been claimed by Adam Smith. Further, his work contributed to something sociologists refer to as the &quot;Theory of Reciprocity.&quot; (p 219) The idea that many types of social behavior are reciprocity at work, in exchanges. Gift giving is rewarded with generosity. Violence is repaid with violence. Again, referring to the !Kung, the author shores up this point. &quot;Gifts are not only exchanged with neighbors and close relatives; they are traded between partners over a distance of hundreds of miles. Many adults have a number of partners, sometimes dozens spread over a great area. !Kung adults spend a great deal of time and energy traveling across the desert to visit relatives and exchange-partners, depending on their hospitality and exchanging gifts with them.&quot; (p 224)</p><p>Again, I am reminded of Goodall. Chimpanzees curry favor with each other for what can appear purely social reasons. They can give gifts of food or grooming for self-interest, such as forming an alliance with a higher ranked ape. Given that all of these building blocks posited to be the foundation of society have parallels within Chimpanzee society, easily our closest living relative, it does not seem to be a stretch to see human forms of these things as elaborate versions of our primate behavior. Graft enough gray matter onto the existing primate brain and you have the capacity for richly divergent behavior, all within the framework of a biologically defined set of behavioral choices.</p><p>The Second Millennium is the 10th and final chapter in the book. Adam Kuper closes his book, primarily focusing on the impact of man on the environment. He brings up the oft-quoted Malthus, with his predictions of doom. In 1798, Robert Malthus first suggested that populations grow exponentially and that food supplies arithmetically, guaranteeing eventual starvation and pestilence. The author introduces us to this apocalyptic view by first discussing Christian and Jewish eschatology, offering the reader a cultural context for rationally based predictions of doom.</p><p>Mr. Kuper offers some alternative views by mentioning alternative theorists who believe that population growth is the cause of increased productivity and mentioning that mostly, food production has outstripped population growth. He also documents several cases of especially brutal famine, tracing their origins to the policy choices of the elite political leaders within the country of tragedy: Joseph Stalin and Mao Tse-Tung and colonial powers.</p><p>This chapter is rather disjointed from the rest of the book, and only appears related, in the sense that secular millenarians, as he refers to the doom-sayers of the post-ecclesiastical era believe that man does have an evolutionary adaptation to a particular environment and the one in which we live is at odds with those adaptations. True to form, Adam Kuper draws a complicated picture, by giving a variety of alternative interpretations of the commonly used anecdotes. His conclusion is mankind is likely to live through the next millennium.</p><p>This book is valuable for those who are looking for a brief survey of the last 100 years of anthropology. It does cover some common ground, and disappoints only in its emphasis on historical precedent to the various views de-emphasizing some of the modern work. Additionally, it appears that Mr. Kuper's skepticism over the more far-reaching conclusions of the social-biological crowd plays a little strongly at times. For instance, a cross-cultural view of beauty or desirability such as the ratio between the width of a woman's hips and her waste-line among males exists, regardless of the culture's view of weight. That is, cultures - which admire heavier women, prefer the same ratio as cultures, which prefer thinner women. (A recapitulation of recent research in the New York times notes that women, in all cultures have been pointed out to prefer males with round, boyish faces. This preference is especially true if the male's physical features place him outside the racial clan of the viewer.) It appears that Adam Kuper simply did not accept some of the obvious comparisons that can be done between humans and chimpanzees with only a cursory reading of Jane Goodall. Nevertheless, the book was extremely well written and researched.</p><p>It is clear to me that I need to read more primary source material. &quot;Modern Syntheses,&quot; to use Adam Kuper's words and anthropology text books make me vulnerable to the point of view of the author, even well-meaning authors such as Mr. Kuper.</p>
